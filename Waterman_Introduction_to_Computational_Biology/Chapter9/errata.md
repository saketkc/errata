**Pages** 184-185: On page 184,: *If $a_2$ is deleted, we maintain
.....* Error: c=A-CGC Correction: c=A-TGC Why?: The statement says $a_2$
is deleted, which is correctly depicted by $c$ but then it also makes an
erroneous substitution at $a_3$

*On page 185: *Define $S=S'-5 log s$ ....* Error:
$\delta=log(\sqrt(s)/r)$ Correction: $\delta=log(s/r)$ WHY?: Let’s start
from scratch:\
Given: $S=S' -5\ log\ s$ and $log(p/s)=1$*

[eq:185] S’= 3 log p + log q + 2 log r\
S = S’-5 log s = 3(log p - log s) + (log q - log s) + 2(log r - log s)\
S = 3 - $\mu$ - 2$\delta$

Comparing [eq:185]b and [eq:185]c we see:\
$\delta = log(s/r)$
